This project creates an interactive 3D digital twin of urban areas using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It features automated building data extraction, 3D rendering with CesiumJS, and a user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing city structures. The system includes a unique ID scheme, 3D tiling, and will be deployed in two major cities (pop. > 1M). It combines geospatial data processing, 3D visualization, and web development to support urban planning and analysis.
